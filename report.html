<h1>CP1406/1806/5638 - 2017 Group Project Report</h1>
<h2>Group Number 47</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> Mikayla Ingham (jc321351)</p>
<h2>Project Links</h2>

<h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
<p>All project work was completed by myself.</p>

<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>The javascript is very basic; it's something I had no knowledge of before starting this project and so I hoped to add smooth transitions and effects however I just did not have the time to add this. I decided it was more important to have as much basic functionality as possible rather that make it look super fancy. There is no form validation.</p>
    <p>Not all pages have been completed; only the first few musicians have their own page.</p>
    
<h2>References</h2>
<p>Other than general learning resources/looking at others' code to determine functionality, no specific code was copied into the website.</p>

<h2>PMI</h2>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> ...</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Looking back, I wish that I had chosen a different theme and design style to work with, something that looked more professional and clean.
    <br>Time management was a big downfall, especially not being able to have other team members to help out both with the workload and skill gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> As mentioned earlier, I had no knowledge of javascript before this assignment. While the code written is most likely unorthodox/clunky way of coding, I feel accomplished creating different behaviours on my own.</p>
